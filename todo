+ Change generation of "monteCarloValue" to "randInRange"
+ Optimize speed: take out unecessary setups of parameters.
* Make a README file and define stuff like ranges, parameters, hypercube, step-hypercube, fnData, clData, Monte Carlo integration ..
* Check how the program behaves when the input function definition file is empty or the command line is empty.
* Check options don't appear more than once in a command line.
* Add checks for function name. Should be a C literal like all other user visible names.
* Update "checkCommandLine" option name test. Should upgrade the re used.
* Add checks for range and param names. They should be treated as C literals.
