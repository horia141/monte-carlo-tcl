* Add coments for function definition file.
* Add the ability to use parameters in rage beg/end definitions.
* Add the ability to use expressions in range/params definitions.
+ Add the simplest test: the function definition file is a valid tcl list.
+ Change "_recMinMax" to use upvar a lot instead of "array get"/"array set" etc.
+ Change generation of "monteCarloValue" to "randInRange"
+ Optimize speed: take out unecessary setups of parameters.
- Make a README file and define stuff like ranges, parameters, hypercube, step-hypercube, fnData, clData, Monte Carlo integration ..
+ Check how the program behaves when the input function definition file is empty or the command line is empty.
+ Check options don't appear more than once in a command line.
+ Add checks for function name. Should be a C literal like all other user visible names.
+ Update "checkCommandLine" option name test. Should upgrade the re used.
+ Add checks for range and param names. They should be treated as C literals.
